# 📄 Executive Summary Generator  
_An interactive dashboard that turns work noise into leadership-ready updates_

## 💡 What This Is

An **interactive, real-time dashboard** that helps teams turn their work updates—like status reports, task lists, and KPIs—into a clear, concise executive summary.

It replaces slide decks and long reports with a structured overview that highlights what’s been done, what’s blocked, and what’s next—so leaders can quickly understand progress and priorities.

## ❗️ Problem: The Report That No One Reads

Most teams spend hours every week creating detailed status reports and slide decks that no one actually reads. Critical updates get buried in noise, while leadership lacks a clear, consistent view of what’s really happening. The real work lives in tools and conversations—not in PowerPoint—and the reporting process has become a ritual with little value.

This project solves that by using a live dashboard to generate concise, executive-level summaries from raw work data, surfacing what truly matters.
